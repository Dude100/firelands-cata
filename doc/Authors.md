The **Firelands Core Project** is the work of many awesome people, and contributors
from all over the world, and is the result of quite a few predecessors.

This file contains all the projects and people involved in the project and its'
creation.

History
-------
The roots of *mangos* date back to 2004, many developers were anxious to get
a working server for the World of Warcraft beta running at that time.

Various projects such as *TeamPython*, *Wow Python* and *WoWd* produced GPL'd
server code, and furthered the development of a few World of Warcraft servers for the community.

* **2004**: *TeamPython*, *Wow Python* and *WoWd* develop the predecessors for
  *mangos*.
* **2005**: the *MaNGOS project* - an abbreviation for *Massive Network Game
  Object Server* - was founded. The first project website was located at
  http://www.mangosproject.org/ and a couple of other addresses, which are all defunct now. <br />
  The Source code was released
  on SourceForge using Subversion, and old versions are kept there for
  archival to this day. More recent versions of the older server code are archived at Mangos Archives
* **2008**: the *MaNGOS project* grew in terms of users and developers,
  and relocated to github. With the move, the project website changed
  to getmangos.eu
* **2022**: The *Firelands Proeject* - Is a derivation of MaNGOS project that 
  pretends improve the way that the changes can be done in the core, using a modular system to load modules with an standard
  to be more developer friendly and trying to create a community that helps to fix all of the blizzlike things to create the most stable
  core for everyone.
